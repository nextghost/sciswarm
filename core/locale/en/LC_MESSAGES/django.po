"Most social networks are about interacting with other users directly. This "

"can think of Sciswarm as a massively collaborative overlay journal where you "
"get to pick your own editorial board by following people you trust. But it's "
"not an overlay of any particular preprint repository. It's an overlay of the "
"entire body of scientific literature, including papers published in "
"paywalled journals. Sciswarm stores only basic paper metadata and links to "
"content hosted elsewhere (sometimes behind paywall) so that you don't have "
"to compromise between your career advancement and supporting Open Access. "
"When Sciswarm paper metrics become more important than journal impact "

"Sciswarm currently supports importing paper metadata from <a href=\"https://"

"papers are therefore imported only with plain author names."
msgstr ""

"Another import problem is that arXiv doesn't treat DOI as a unique "
"identifier. Multiple papers from different authors often have the same DOI, "
"and this DOI sometimes belongs to a whole collection of papers rather than "
"any specific paper. Sciswarm assigns the DOI to the first paper that appears "

        <h1>Sciswarm &mdash; Introduction</h1>
        <p><strong>What if preprints could achieve the same formal impact as papers published in a journal, but without going through the traditional publishing machinery? The main difference between preprints and published scientific papers is formal validation through peer review. What preprints need to become first-class citizens of academic libraries is a formal validation process that's separate from traditional journals. Sciswarm is an online platform which enables such validation without preventing submission to any journal at the same time.</strong></p>
        <p>But first things first. Sciswarm is something between a social network and a massively collaborative overlay journal. The system is currently in alpha stage and I need a few volunteers to test the usefulness of the social features. This webpage is a short tour of the Sciswarm features which aren't immediately visible to unregistered users. Link to Sciswarm itself is at the end of this tour.</p>
        <p>Sciswarm works with paper metadata so that you can post all your papers in it, including those published in paywalled journals. But you don't need to worry about entering dozens of papers into the system yourself. Sciswarm currently contains metadata of over 1.5 million preprints from arXiv and new preprints are imported every day. So if you've read any arXiv preprints or their published versions in the past month, you can simply register, claim ownership of your own preprints with a few clicks and you're ready to start testing.</p>
        <p>Here's a fictional paper in Sciswarm as seen by the author:</p>

      <div class="box">
        <p>The interesting bit is the review metrics table. &#8220;Global&#8221; metrics are calculated from all reviews. &#8220;Your network&#8221; metrics are calculated using only reviews from people you follow. Other metrics will be implemented later. You'll find more about identifiers and bibliography in Sciswarm Help pages.</p>
        <p>Here are the reviews which produced the metrics above. Guess which reviewer isn't followed by the author:</p>

      <div class="screenshot"><a href="img/reviews-list.png"><img src="img/reviews-list.png" alt="Screenshot: List of reviews for a paper in Sciswarm" title="List of paper reviews"/></a></div>

      <div class="box">
        <p>Authors can respond to a review, for example to clear up any misunderstandings. The discussion is public but read-only to everyone except the reviewer and paper authors.</p>

      <div class="screenshot"><a href="img/review-detail.png"><img src="img/review-detail.png" alt="Screenshot: Discussion between review author and paper authors in Sciswarm" title="Discussion under a review"/></a></div>

      <div class="box">
        <p>And the feature that should be most useful to you from the beginning is the timeline. Here you'll find new papers, reviews and recommendations from people you follow. Which of course means that you'll need to test the system together with your colleagues.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="screenshot"><a href="img/timeline.png"><img src="img/timeline.png" alt="Screenshot: Timeline of events in Sciswarm (new papers, reviews and recommendations from people you follow)" title="User timeline"/></a></div>

      <div class="box">
        <p>Sciswarm also has some utility features like delegating paper management to other users and simple claiming of paper authorship through identifier or name match. But those are not the primary reason why you'd want to use the system so let's end the tour here. The user interface is far from finished and there are lots of planned features, for example:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>Paper collections</li>
	  <li>Improved paper search</li>
	  <li>RSS feeds</li>
	  <li>Algorithmic paper recommendations</li>
	  <li>Research replication tracking</li>
	  <li>User groups and discussions</li>
	  <li>Open data, etc.</li>
	</ul>
        <p>Sciswarm is <a href="https://github.com/nextghost/sciswarm">free software</a> and the system should eventually become a global network of interconnected servers owned by research institutions themselves.
